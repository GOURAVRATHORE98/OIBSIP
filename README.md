Title: Simple Password Generator in Python

Description:
The "Password Generator" is a Python script that allows users to create secure and random passwords with a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers. The program prompts the user to input the desired quantities for each category and ensures that the inputs are valid (non-negative). It then generates a password by randomly selecting characters from predefined sets of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers. The script utilizes the random module for the selection process and ensures that the generated password is shuffled for added security.

The generated password is displayed to the user, and in case the inputs are invalid or result in an empty password, appropriate messages are displayed. The script is a simple yet effective tool for creating diverse and strong passwords, which can be useful for enhancing security across various online platforms.

To use the Password Generator, users can run the script and follow the prompts to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. The final password is then presented to them for immediate use. The script provides a basic foundation for a password generator, and users can modify and extend it based on their specific requirements or integrate it into other projects as needed.


Certainly! Let's break down the code line by line:

```python
import random
```
- This line imports the `random` module, which is used to generate random values. In this script, it will be used to randomly select letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.

```python
print("Welcome to the Password Generator!")
```
- This line prints a welcome message to the user, indicating that they are using a Password Generator.

```python
let = int(input("How many letters you want in your password?\n"))
sym = int(input("How many symbols you want in your password?\n"))
num = int(input("How many numbers you want in your password?\n"))
```
- These lines prompt the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password, and convert the input values to integers.

```python
if ((let < 0) or (sym < 0) or (num < 0)):
    print("Invalid input.")
```
- This block checks if any of the input values for the number of letters, symbols, or numbers is less than 0. If any of them are negative, it prints an "Invalid input" message.

```python
else:
    list = []
```
- If the input values are valid, an empty list named `list` is created to store the characters of the password.

```python
    for i in range(0, let):
        random_letters = random.choice(['a', 'b', ..., 'Y', 'Z'])
        list.append(random_letters)
```
- This loop generates random letters and appends them to the list `let` times. The letters are selected randomly from a predefined list of lowercase and uppercase letters.

```python
    for i in range(0, sym):
        random_symbols = random.choice(['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+'])
        list.append(random_symbols)
```
- This loop generates random symbols and appends them to the list `sym` times. Symbols are selected randomly from a predefined list.

```python
    for i in range(0, num):
        random_numbers = random.choice(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'])
        list.append(random_numbers)
```
- This loop generates random numbers and appends them to the list `num` times. Numbers are selected randomly from a predefined list.

```python
    random.shuffle(list)
```
- This line shuffles the elements in the list randomly, ensuring that the characters in the password are in a random order.

```python
    if (len(list) == 0):
        print("No password generated.")
```
- This block checks if the length of the list is zero. If it is, it means no characters were added to the password, and it prints a message indicating that no password was generated.

```python
    else:
        password = ''
        for i in list:
            password = password + i
        print(f"Your password is: {password}")
```
- If the length of the list is not zero, it means characters have been added to the password. This block concatenates the characters in the list to form the final password, which is then printed to the user. The password is displayed in a formatted message.

This script provides a basic structure for a password generator, allowing users to customize the length and composition of their passwords.
